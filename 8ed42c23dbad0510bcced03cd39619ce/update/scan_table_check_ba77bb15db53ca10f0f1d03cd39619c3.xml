        <description>UI Actions should either be executed on the server side or on the client side. However, the platform supports a pattern that allows a mix of server and client side code. This pattern is described in KB1005843 and is used in some OOTB UI Actions.&#13;
This pattern should NOT be used for the following reasons:&#13;
1. Including server-side code in a UI Action script that is executed on the client-side exposes logic that is to be executed on the server - which may potentially be used by an attacker - and hence implies a security risk.&#13;
2. To maintain code quality Instance Scan checks or othe rstatic code analysis tools can used to analyse code. However, different rules may apply for client-side and server-side code - which makes it extremely difficult to assess compliance to the coding guideline if client-side and server-side code is mixed in a single script.</description>

        <priority>1</priority>
        <resolution_details>UI Actions that use the described pattern must be refactored to contain either client-sided or server-sided code only.&#13;
The typical use-case for the pattern are operations that require some user interaction before a server-sided process is started.&#13;
E.g. this could be an additional confirmation dialog that a user must answer or additional data checks that may result in specific messages to be displayed to the user.&#13;
In that case, the UI Action should be using a client-side script that manages the user interaction and performs one or more AJAX request to a client-callable Script Include to trigger the server-side operation.&#13;
This pattern also allows to start lengthy operations while displaying a progress dialog to the user. The client script then also maintains full control over the page to be navigated to at the end of the operation if required.</resolution_details>
